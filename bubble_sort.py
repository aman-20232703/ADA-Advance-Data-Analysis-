Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top.

How it Works:
Compare adjacent elements
If they are in wrong order, swap them
Continue for all pairs in the array
Repeat the process until no swaps are needed

Time Complexity
Best Case: O(n) - When array is already sorted (with optimized version)
Average Case: O(nÂ²) - On average, we need to do nÂ²/2 comparisons
Worst Case: O(nÂ²) - When array is sorted in reverse order

Space Complexity
O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra space
