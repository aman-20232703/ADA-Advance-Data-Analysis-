ðŸ”¹ Linear Search

Definition: Check each element in the list one by one until the target is found or the list ends.
Works On: Both sorted and unsorted lists.
Approach: Sequential search.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if target is at the beginning)
Worst Case: O(n) (if target is at the end or not present)
Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra memory needed).
Ease of Use: Simple, easy to implement.
Efficiency: Slow for large datasets.
