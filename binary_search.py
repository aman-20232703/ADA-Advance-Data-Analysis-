"""
Binary Search

Definition: Repeatedly divides the sorted list into halves to locate the target.
Works On: Only sorted lists/arrays.
Approach: Divide and Conquer.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if middle element is the target)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative, O(log n) for recursive implementation.
Ease of Use: Slightly more complex to implement than linear search.
Efficiency: Much faster than linear search on large datasets.
