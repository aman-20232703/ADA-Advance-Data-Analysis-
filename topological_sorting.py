Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u-v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u-v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

Time Complexity: O(V+E). The above algorithm is simply DFS with an extra stack. So time complexity is the same as DFS.
