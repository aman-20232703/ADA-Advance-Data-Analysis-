Definition
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly inserting a new element into the sorted portion of an array. It works similar to how you sort playing cards in your hands.

How it Works
Start with the second element (consider first element as sorted)
Compare it with elements in the sorted portion
Shift elements greater than current element to the right
Insert current element at its correct position
Repeat for all elements

Time Complexity
Best Case: O(n) - When array is already sorted (only one comparison per element)
Average Case: O(n²) - On average, each element is compared with half the sorted portion
Worst Case: O(n²) - When array is sorted in reverse order

Space Complexity
O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra space
