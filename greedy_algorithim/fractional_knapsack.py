"""
Given two arrays, val[] and wt[], representing the values and weights of item respectively, and an integer capacity representing the maximum weight a knapsack can hold, we have to determine the maximum total value that can be achieved by putting the items in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
Items can also be taken in fractional parts if required.

nput: val[] = [60, 100, 120], wt[] = [10, 20, 30], capacity = 50
Output: 240 
Explanation: We will take the items of weight 10kg and 20kg and 2/3 fraction of 30kg. 
Hence total value will be 60 + 100 + (2/3) * 120 = 240.

Input: val[] = [500], wt[] = [30], capacity = 10
Output: 166.667
